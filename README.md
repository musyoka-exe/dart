# Dart Programming Examples

This repository contains a collection of basic Dart programming examples that demonstrate fundamental programming concepts. Each file focuses on a specific concept, making it ideal for beginners learning Dart.

## Files and Concepts

1. **`1.hello.dart`** - Basic "Hello World" program
   - Introduction to the `main` function
   - Using `print()` to output text

2. **`2.add.dart`** - Basic arithmetic operations
   - Variable declaration with type annotations
   - Integer operations
   - Simple addition and output

3. **`3.decision.dart`** - Conditional statements
   - `if-else` statements
   - Comparison operators
   - Decision making in programs

4. **`4.logic.dart`** - Logical operators and complex conditions
   - `&&` (AND) and `||` (OR) operators
   - Complex conditional statements
   - `else if` chains

5. **`5.switch.dart`** - Switch-case statements
   - Using switch for multiple conditions
   - Case matching
   - Default case handling

6. **`5.switch1.dart`** - Additional switch-case example
   - Alternative switch-case implementation

7. **`6.loop.dart`** - For loops
   - Traditional for loop syntax
   - Loop counters and conditions

8. **`6.loop1.dart`** - Additional for loop example
   - Alternative for loop implementation

9. **`7.while.dart`** - While loops
   - Pre-test loop structure
   - Counter-controlled loops

10. **`8do-while.dart`** - Do-while loops
    - Post-test loop structure
    - Ensuring loop executes at least once

11. **`9.break.dart`** - Break statements
    - Exiting loops prematurely
    - Control flow manipulation

12. **`10.continue.dart`** - Continue statements
    - Skipping iterations in loops
    - Control flow manipulation

13. **`10.continue1.dart`** - Advanced continue usage
    - Combining continue and break statements
    - Complex loop control

## How to Run

To run any of these examples, you need to have the Dart SDK installed on your system. Then execute:

```bash
dart filename.dart
```

For example:
```bash
dart 1.hello.dart
```

## Prerequisites

- [Dart SDK](https://dart.dev/get-dart) installed on your system

## Learning Path

These examples are ordered to provide a progressive learning experience:
1. Start with basic output (`1.hello.dart`)
2. Learn about variables and operations (`2.add.dart`)
3. Understand decision making (`3.decision.dart`, `4.logic.dart`)
4. Explore different control structures (`5.switch.dart`, `6.loop.dart`, `7.while.dart`, `8do-while.dart`)
5. Master loop control (`9.break.dart`, `10.continue.dart`, `10.continue1.dart`)
